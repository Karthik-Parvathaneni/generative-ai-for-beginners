    "# Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts for natural language processing tasks. It involves selecting the right prompts, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance. Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in NLP models. In this section, we will explore the basics of prompt engineering using the OpenAI models for exploration."

      "- Disputes over Martian independence, planetary resources (like water and rare elements), and Earth-Martian trade tariffs led to growing tensions between Earth's governments and the Mars colonial administration.  \n",

      "a) **Social Impact**: What led Martians to demand independence? How did the war affect civilians on both planets?  \n",
      "b) **Key Battles**: Imagine and describe a pivotal battle during the war (e.g., \"The Siege of Olympus Mons\"). How was it fought? What technology was used?  \n",
      "c) **Political Outcomes**: How did Earth's governments and corporations respond? Did the war end in a negotiated treaty, a Martian victory, or an Earth victory?  \n",
      "d) **Technology of the War**: What weapons, spacecraft, or tactics were used? Imagine futuristic inventions and their effects on the conflict.  \n",
